# Init project

Hello world ! Now I will show you how to setup project from scratch.

## Init Express project

First, we have to install express-generator globally.

npm install -g express-generator
```

Then, generate new project by using these command line.

```sh
express --view=ejs APPDEV_PROJECT
```
